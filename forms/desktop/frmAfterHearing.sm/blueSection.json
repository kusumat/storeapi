Your request must be in writing and received within the time frame outlined in your decision. The Office of Legal Services then reviews the hearing decision and issues an Administrative Appeal decision stating whether or not the Hearing Decision was correct. The Administrative Appeal decision is the final decision of the Department and is appealable to Common Pleas Court. You can access public record versions of State Hearing and Administrative Appeal decisions issued by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services on their website."
